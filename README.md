This is the dynamic model of a satellite with two solar pannels and a 3DoF pendulum representing the fuel tank. The code is writen using MATLAB by Lagrangian method. an animation of the satellite moving with a random initial conditon is presented. The correctness of the model has been also validated with the help of energy test
